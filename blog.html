                    <h2>Learn HTML</h2>
                    <p>While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of mind-boggling theory, this
                        tutorial will instead focus on giving you the practical skills to build your first site.

                        The aim is to show you how to create your first web page without spending the entire tutorial
                        focusing too much on the “why.”

                        By the end of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website and we hope
                        that this will inspire you to delve further into the world of HTML using our follow-on guides.

                    <h2>Learn CSS</h2>
                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                        document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
                        describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                        CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers
                        according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS
                        specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest
                        recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a
                        CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.

                        After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on
                        different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and
                        release recommendations separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C
                        now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and
                        individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color
                        Module Level 5.</p><button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://www.w3schools.com/css/ ';" ;

                    <h2>Learn Javascript</h2>
                    <p>JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use
                        JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
                        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

                        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                        standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
                        functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
                        styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
                        expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                        graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript
                        APIs for I/O.

                        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of
                        some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is
                        Node.js.

                        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the
                        two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p><button

                    <h2>Learn React</h2>
                    <p>Declarative
                        React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your
                        application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your
                        data changes.

                        Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.

                        Component-Based
                        Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex
                        UIs.

                        Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich
                        data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

                        Learn Once, Write Anywhere
                        We dont make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new
                        features in React without rewriting existing code.

                        React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.</p>

                    <h2>Learn Node js</h2>
                    <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix,
                        macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript
                        Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

                        Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
                        scripting. The functionality of running scripts server-side produces dynamic web page content
                        before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a
                        "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single
                        programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

                        Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim
                        to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as
                        well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser
                        games).[7]

                        The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js
                        Foundation,[8] and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS
                        Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9]</p>
